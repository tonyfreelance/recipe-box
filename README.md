# Recipe Box

This is my app which I used to learn React, Redux, react-bootstrap. Thanks a lots for the team who created awesome [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) bundle!

This app includes 2 parts:
- First one is local recipe box which users will manually add recipes and the app will save them all into **Google Firebase**
- Second one is online search which use external API to request and show the recipes' images and titles.

## How to run this example:
- Clone into your local machine, then run:

`(sudo) npm install`

- After installing dependencies, run:

`npm start`
